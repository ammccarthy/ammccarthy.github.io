											<h2>Outreach</h2>
											<h3>Al The Science Gal</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											At the height of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic, I was looking for a way to continue 
											the outreach efforts that I had been so passionate about during my undergraduate career.
											Thus, my YouTube Channel, "Al the Science Gal" was born. Here, I post videos about my 
											experience in STEM, as well as professional developement videos. Moving forward, I hope to 
											document my experience in graduate school, interview other graduate students, and discuss 
											diversity in STEM, amongst other things. 
										</p>

											<h3>National Technical Institute for the Deaf Mentoring Program</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Did you know that in the past 20 years only 7 Ph.D.s were awarded to Deaf individuals 
											worldwide? Based on the Deaf US population statistics, we should expect 3-4 deaf graduate 
											students, and 3-4 deaf faculty members in Astronomy. As a result of this dispartiy, Prof. P.
											Muirhead and Prof. J. Nordhaus (National Technical Institute for the Deaf) are 
											working to breaking down barriers for deaf and hard-of-hearing students in astronomy by 
											creating a summer research internship program at Boston University. As life
											begins to return to normal, I will work with Prof. Muirhead and Prof. Nordhaus to create a 
											peer mentorship program between graduate students at Boston University and undergraduate 
											students at NTID. These mentors will support the NTID students both during and after their 
											time as summer research interns.

											<h3>Spooky Lab- Haunting at the Museum</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Each year, The University of Alabama Museum of Natual History hosts an event around Halloween
											for families to come and learn about "spooky" science. As co-founder and vice president of 
											The University of Alabama Society of Physics Students, I involved the physics department in the 
											event for the first time. The SPS executive board planned and executed the entire event. Families
											were able to come and and learn about the science behind "ghosts" (hankercheifs over floating magnets), 
											"spooky scientist hair" (Van der Graaf generator), "Halloween's cradle" 
											(Newton's cradle with plastic pumpkins), and much more!.

											<h3>Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics 2019</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The APS CUWiP is a series of regional conferences held simultaneously around the United States and Canada 
											for undergraduate women interested in physics.In January 2019, The University of Alabama hosted the 
											Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics. In the year leading up to the event, the local organizing 
											committee (of which I was a part of) met to plan the activities, speakers, poster session, 
											panel discussions, etc. for the event. This event allowed women and gender minorities to network with people 
											of all ages and professional levels, discuss graduate school and career oportunities, as well as learn about 
											the cutting-edge science being done by women across the field.
