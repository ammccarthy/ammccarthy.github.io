											<h2>Research</h2>
											<h3>Boston University</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											I am working in the low-mass star group lead by Prof. P. Muirhead at Boston University.
											I am a member of the PINES (Perkins INfrared Exosatellite Survey) Collaboration. PINES is 
											a search for transiting exosattelites (exoplanets or exomoons, depending on the
											classification of the host) around L and T type dwarfs. 
										</p>
										<p>
											L-type and T-type dwarfs are unique objects; depending on their mass they can be 
											classified as hydrogen fusing stars, brown dwarfs, or free-floating planets. 
											All of these objects have masses ranging from 0.005 to 0.080 solar masses and have
											radii roughly equal to that of Jupiter. Because L and T dwarfs span the gap between
											these classifications, they are unique laboratories to help us learn more about the
											similarities and differences in the formation, convection, and angular momentum evolution
											of all three object types.
										</p>
										<p>
											L and T type dwarfs are known to be photometrically variable, and it is believed that 
											early L objects variability is caused by magnetic spots on the surface, while late L and
											T type dwarfs variabilty is caused by a cloudy atmosphere. The exact transition from 
											magnetic to cloudy variability is not known, and will be the focus of my project.

											<h3>The American Museum of Natural History</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											In the summer of 2019, I had the privilege of completing an REU with the Brown Dwarfs in 
											New York City (BDNYC) group at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). Here, I 
											worked with Prof. Kelle Cruz, Dr. Jackie Faherty, and Dr. Johanna Vos to determine the 
											rotation rates of 26 brown dwarfs from the Kepler 2 mission. Typically, brown dwarfs 
											and low mass stars are observed in the infrared, since that is the wavelength that the
											objects are brightest in. We wanted to see if it was possible to detect variability, 
											and therefore rotation rates, using optical observations, and determine how the 
											lightcurves compared to their infrared counterparts. Out of the 26 objects, I was able 
											to detect two rotation rates, both of which matched previously detected rotation rates 
											in the infrared. For one of these objects, I was able to determine the light curve
											evolution. I presented this research at the American Astronomical Society winter meeting 
											in 2020 and was awarded a Chambliss Astronomy Achievement Award Student Prize for my 
											presentation.
										</p>

											<h3>The University of Alabama</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											From August 2017 to May 2020, I worked with Dr. Jeremy Bailin to create Color-Magnitude 
											Diagrams (CMDs) of galaxies in the MUGS simulations- a set of 16 Milky Way like galaxies
											simulated using N-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics at high resolution. During the 
											first two semesters that I worked on the project, I created over 10,000 synthetic images
											of these simulated galaxies and created the CMDs for each. We use these CMDs to compare the MUGS 
											galaxies to MilkyWay like galaxies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. I have had 
											the opportunity to present this research multiple times, both as an oral presentation 
											for RRS Live, an online broadcasted research symposium, in poster presentations at 
											URCA (Undergraduate Research and Creative Activity Conference), and CUWiP. I have also been a 
											mentor to undergraduate students taking over this project as I transitioned to graduate school.

											<h3>Green Bank Observatory</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											In the summer of 2018, I worked with Dr. Andrew Seymour studying Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). I 
											analyzed Arecibo Telescope data of FRB110523 with the hope of detecting a repeat burst. 
											I detected one potential burst candidate which was then used in a successful proposal for
											follow-up observations. I presented this research at the American Astronomical Society 
											winter meeting in 2019, as well as at CUWiP. It has since been determined that FRB110523
											is not a repeating FRB.
